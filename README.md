This project is working with STM32F411VET6 microcontroller and using STM32CubeIDE. In this project, i created my own library to configure the microcontroller by setting bits in registers. These are key features of project:
- Setting input/output signal with GPIO ports
- Control Led
- Configuring timer
- Handling Interrups of button
- Configuring USART using both interrupt and dma
- Configuring SPI
- Configuring I2C
- Update firmware through USART
